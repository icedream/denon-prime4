        The choice of FFT library makes no difference to output quality, only to
        processing speed.

config BR2_PACKAGE_RUBBERBAND_FFT_BUILTIN
    bool "Built-in"
    help
        Default.

config BR2_PACKAGE_RUBBERBAND_FFT_FFTW
    bool "FFTW"
    depends on BR2_PACKAGE_FFTW
    help
        A bit faster than built-in. GPL licence.

        Single precision. Only advisable when using single-precision sample type
        (see below). BSD-ish licence.

    prompt "Rubberband Resampler"
    default BR2_PACKAGE_RUBBERBAND_RESAMPLER_BUILTIN
    help
        The choice of resampler affects both output quality, when
        pitch-shifting, and CPU usage.

config BR2_PACKAGE_RUBBERBAND_RESAMPLER_BUILTIN
    bool "Built-in"
    help
        Default. Intended to give high quality for time-varying pitch shifts in
        real-time mode. Not the fastest option.

config BR2_PACKAGE_RUBBERBAND_RESAMPLER_LIBSAMPLERATE
    bool "libsamplerate"
    select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBSAMPLERATE
    help
        Good choice in most cases. High quality and usually a bit faster than
        the built-in option. BSD-ish licence.
